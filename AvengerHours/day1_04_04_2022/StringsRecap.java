    String -> object type. Sequences of chars
    String class is a member of java.lang package. No need to import
    There are 2 ways to create string object;
    1)String literal(mostly used) String str = "Apple";
    Created in String pool in heap memory
    2) New keyword -> String str2 = new String ("Apple");
    Created in heap directly

    ** Both are same in terms of usage, but only differs for memory allocation.

    String objects are immutable which means unmodifiable /unchangeable.

    String a = "apple"; // a new obj is created in str pool in heap
    a = "Apple"
